# Supplementary Materials for VIS 2024 Submission - Diverse Data Selection

## Sampling Code

The code we used for sampling can be found in the [./sampling/](sampling/) folder. 
The code for visualizing the sampled datasets can be found in the file [./sampling/vis.py](vis.py) file in [./sampling/](sampling/).

## Data

The datasets can be found at the following links:

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/uspollution/](U.S. Pollution Dataset)
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dermisfit/fraud-transactions-dataset](Credit Card Fraud Dataset)
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tapive/google-play-apps-and-games](Apps and Games Dataset)
[./data/mnist/mnist.npz](MNIST dataset)
[./data/control.csv](Fashion Dataset (used in pilot))

The Hidden Correlation Dataset was synthesized by us, and is too large to serve online. 

### Samples of the data can be found in the corresponding subfolders in the [./data/](data/) folder

## Study Stimuli

The stimuli for Experiment 1 can be found in the [./exp1/](exp1/) folder.
The stimuli used for the instructions section of Experiment 1 can be found in the [./demo](demo/) and [./demo2](demo2/) folders.
The stimulus for the second attention check is located in the [./attention_check.png](attention_check.png) file.
The stimuli for Experiment 2 can be found in the [./exp2/](exp2/) folder.
The visual literacy stimuli for Experiment 2 can be found in the [./vlat/](vlat/) folder.

## Study Results

The study results can be found in the [./study_data/](study_data/) folder. 
Specifically, the visualized results of Experiment 1 are found in the [./study_data/experiment_heatmaps](study_data/experiment_heatmaps/).
The visualized results of Experiment 2 are found in the [./study_data/exp2_results](study_data/exp2_results/).
Visualizations of the runtimes of the sampling methods can be found in [./study_data/experiment_runtimes](study_data/experiment_runtimes/)
The code we used to generate these data and visualizations are found in the [./Analysis.ipynb](Analysis.ipynb) and [./Runtimes.ipynb](Runtimes.ipynb) files.
